A simple Slack integration to update your team on mornings when air quality is poor to encourage carpooling and working from home as appropriate.

Installation is quick and simple by clicking this button: 

<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=334673942833.530364225924&scope=incoming-webhook"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" /></a>

## Data

Air quality data is pulled daily from [airnowapi.org](https://docs.airnowapi.org). If quality is not good, a single message will be sent to the Slack channel you've approved.

## Other Installation?

If you don't want to click the link above to install then you could create your own Slack Integration and deploy this code to your own Heroku account to have a completely isolated instance of the Air Quality Control Slack Integration.

[The code](https://github.com/troylelandshields/airqualitycontrol) is completely free and open source, so if you have new features to contribute (like being able to configure the Zip Code) feel free to help out!

## Dislaimer

This is in no way affiliated with any official government bodies or anything. I'm just a developer in Utah who cares about air quality.
